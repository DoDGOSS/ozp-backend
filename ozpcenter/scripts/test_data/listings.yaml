    description: 'A personal computer (PC) is a multi-purpose electronic computer
      whose size, capabilities, and price make it feasible for individual use. PCs
      are intended to be operated directly by an end user, rather than by a computer
      expert or technician.


      "Computers were invented to ''compute'': to solve complex mathematical problems,
      but today, due to media dependency and the everyday use of computers, it is
      seen that ''computing'' is the least important thing computers do."[1] The computer
      time-sharing models that were typically used with larger, more expensive minicomputer
      and mainframe systems, to enable them be used by many people at the same time,
      are not used with PCs.


      Early computer owners in the 1960s, invariably institutional or corporate, had
      to write their own programs to do any useful work with the machines. In the
      2010s, personal computer users have access to a wide range of commercial software,
      free software ("freeware") and free and open-source software, which are provided
      in ready-to-run form. Software for personal computers is typically developed
      and distributed independently from the hardware or OS manufacturers.[2] Many
      personal computer users no longer need to write their own programs to make any
      use of a personal computer, although end-user programming is still feasible.
      This contrasts with systems such as smartphones or tablet computers, where software
      is often only available through a manufacturer-supported channel, and end-user
      program development may be discouraged by lack of support by the manufacturer.


      Since the early 1990s, Microsoft operating systems and Intel hardware have dominated
      much of the personal computer market, first with MS-DOS and then with Windows.
      Alternatives to Microsoft''s Windows operating systems occupy a minority share
      of the industry. These include Apple''s macOS and free open-source Unix-like
      operating systems such as Linux. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) provides the main
      alternative to Intel''s processors.'

    description: 'Rail transport is a means of transferring of passengers and goods
      on wheeled vehicles running on rails, also known as tracks. It is also commonly
      referred to as train transport. In contrast to road transport, where vehicles
      run on a prepared flat surface, rail vehicles (rolling stock) are directionally
      guided by the tracks on which they run. Tracks usually consist of steel rails,
      installed on ties (sleepers) and ballast, on which the rolling stock, usually
      fitted with metal wheels, moves. Other variations are also possible, such as
      slab track, where the rails are fastened to a concrete foundation resting on
      a prepared subsurface.


      Rolling stock in a rail transport system generally encounters lower frictional
      resistance than road vehicles, so passenger and freight cars (carriages and
      wagons) can be coupled into longer trains. The operation is carried out by a
      railway company, providing transport between train stations or freight customer
      facilities. Power is provided by locomotives which either draw electric power
      from a railway electrification system or produce their own power, usually by
      diesel engines. Most tracks are accompanied by a signalling system. Railways
      are a safe land transport system when compared to other forms of transport.[Nb
      1] Railway transport is capable of high levels of passenger and cargo utilization
      and energy efficiency, but is often less flexible and more capital-intensive
      than road transport, when lower traffic levels are considered.


      The oldest, man-hauled railways date back to the 6th century BC, with Periander,
      one of the Seven Sages of Greece, credited with its invention. Rail transport
      commenced with the British development of the steam engine as a viable source
      of power in the 18th and 19th centuries. Steam locomotives were first developed
      in the United Kingdom in the early 19th century. Built by George Stephenson
      and his son Robert''s company Robert Stephenson and Company, the Locomotion
      No. 1 is the first steam locomotive to carry passengers on a public rail line,
      the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1825. George also built the first public
      inter-city railway line in the world to use steam locomotives, the Liverpool
      and Manchester Railway which opened in 1830. With steam engines, one could construct
      mainline railways, which were a key component of the Industrial Revolution.
      Also, railways reduced the costs of shipping, and allowed for fewer lost goods,
      compared with water transport, which faced occasional sinking of ships. The
      change from canals to railways allowed for "national markets" in which prices
      varied very little from city to city. The invention and development of the railway
      in the United Kingdom was one of the most important technological inventions
      of the 19th century.


      In the 1880s, electrified trains were introduced, and also the first tramways
      and rapid transit systems came into being. Starting during the 1940s, the non-electrified
      railways in most countries had their steam locomotives replaced by diesel-electric
      locomotives, with the process being almost complete by 2000. During the 1960s,
      electrified high-speed railway systems were introduced in Japan and later in
      some other countries. Other forms of guided ground transport outside the traditional
      railway definitions, such as monorail or maglev, have been tried but have seen
      limited use. Following decline after World War II due to competition from cars,
      rail transport has had a revival in recent decades due to road congestion and
      rising fuel prices, as well as governments investing in rail as a means of reducing
      CO2 emissions in the context of concerns about global warming.'

    description: Ten is the debut studio album by American rock band Pearl Jam, released
      on August 27, 1991 through Epic Records. Following the disbanding of bassist
      Jeff Ament and guitarist Stone Gossard's previous group Mother Love Bone, the
      two recruited vocalist Eddie Vedder, guitarist Mike McCready, and drummer Dave
      Krusen to form Pearl Jam in 1990. Most of the songs began as instrumental jams,
      to which Vedder added lyrics about topics such as depression, homelessness,
      and abuse.

    description: 'A map is a symbolic depiction emphasizing relationships between
      elements of some space, such as objects, regions, or themes.


      Many maps are static, fixed to paper or some other durable medium, while others
      are dynamic or interactive. Although most commonly used to depict geography,
      maps may represent any space, real or imagined, without regard to context or
      scale, such as in brain mapping, DNA mapping, or computer network topology mapping.
      The space being mapped may be two dimensional, such as the surface of the earth,
      three dimensional, such as the interior of the earth, or even more abstract
      spaces of any dimension, such as arise in modeling phenomena having many independent
      variables.


      Although the earliest maps known are of the heavens, geographic maps of territory
      have a very long tradition and exist from ancient times. The word "map" comes
      from the medieval Latin Mappa mundi, wherein mappa meant napkin or cloth and
      mundi the world. Thus, "map" became the shortened term referring to a two-dimensional
      representation of the surface of the world.'

      Hartley, Moore and Potter counties and now includes the Lit Farms -- 5000 acres
      of farmland in Hartley and Moore Counties. The ranch's history is as old as
      the history of the Texas Panhandle. The ranch began in the 1880s when Major
      Littlefield discovered the value of the mild climate and protection of the river
      breaks when trail driving cattle from Abilene to Dodge City. Major Littlefield
      sold the ranch to the Prairie Land and Cattle Company, a Scottish land company,
      who developed the ranch into a 240,000 acre ranch stretching from Tascosa to
      Dumas. Lee Bivins purchased the ranch from Prairie in the early 1900s and it
      was operated by the Bivins until 1980s when it was purchased by the W. H. O'Brien
      family of Amarillo, Texas

    description: 'Jean Grey-Summers (born Jean Elaine Grey) is a fictional superhero
      appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character
      has been known under the aliases Marvel Girl, Phoenix, and Dark Phoenix. Created
      by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in The
      X-Men #1 (September 1963).


      Jean Grey is a member of a subspecies of humans known as mutants, who are born
      with superhuman abilities. She was born with telepathic and telekinetic powers.
      Her powers first manifested when she saw her childhood friend being hit by a
      car. She is a caring, nurturing figure, but she also has to deal with being
      an Omega-level mutant and the physical manifestation of the cosmic Phoenix Force.
      Jean Grey experienced a transformation into the Phoenix in the X-Men storyline
      "The Dark Phoenix Saga". She has faced death numerous times in the history of
      the series. Her first death was under her guise as Marvel Girl, when she died
      and was "reborn" as Phoenix in "The Dark Phoenix Saga". This transformation
      led to her second death, which was suicide, though not her last.


      She is an important figure in the lives of other Marvel Universe characters,
      mostly the X-Men, including her husband Cyclops, her mentor and father figure
      Charles Xavier, her unrequited love interest Wolverine, her best friend and
      sister-like figure Storm, and her genetic children Rachel Summers, X-Man, Cable,
      and Stryfe.


      The character was present for much of the X-Men''s history, and she was featured
      in all three X-Men animated series and several video games. She is a playable
      character in X-Men Legends (2004), X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse (2005),
      Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 (2009), Marvel vs Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds (2011),
      Marvel Heroes (2013), and Lego Marvel Super Heroes (2013), and appeared as a
      non-playable in the first Marvel: Ultimate Alliance.


      Famke Janssen portrayed the character in five installments of the X-Men films.
      Sophie Turner portrays a younger version in the 2016 film X-Men: Apocalypse.


      In 2006, IGN rated Jean Grey 6th on their list of top 25 X-Men from the past
      forty years,[1] and in 2011, IGN ranked her 13th in the "Top 100 Comic Book
      Heroes".[2] Her Dark Phoenix persona was ranked 9th in IGN''s "Top 100 Comic
      Book Villains of All Time" list, the highest rank for a female character.[3]'

    description: 'Wolverine (born James Howlett[2] commonly known as Logan and sometimes
      as Weapon X) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published
      by Marvel Comics, mostly in association with the X-Men. He is a mutant who possesses
      animal-keen senses, enhanced physical capabilities, powerful regenerative ability
      known as a healing factor, and three retractable bone claws in each hand. Wolverine
      has been depicted variously as a member of the X-Men, Alpha Flight, and the
      Avengers.


      The character appeared in the last panel of The Incredible Hulk #180 before
      having a larger role in #181 (cover-dated Nov. 1974). He was created by writer
      Len Wein and Marvel art director John Romita, Sr., who designed the character,
      and was first drawn for publication by Herb Trimpe. Wolverine then joined a
      revamped version of the superhero team the X-Men, where eventually writer Chris
      Claremont and artist-writer John Byrne would play significant roles in the character''s
      development. Artist Frank Miller collaborated with Claremont and helped to revise
      the character with a four-part eponymous limited series from September to December
      1982 which debuted Wolverine''s catchphrase, "I''m the best there is at what
      I do, but what I do best isn''t very nice."


      Wolverine is typical of the many tough antiheroes that emerged in American popular
      culture after the Vietnam War;[3] his willingness to use deadly force and his
      brooding nature became standard characteristics for comic book antiheroes by
      the end of the 1980s.[4] As a result, the character became a fan favorite of
      the increasingly popular X-Men franchise,[5] and has been featured in his own
      solo comic since 1988.


      He has appeared in most X-Men adaptations, including animated television series,
      video games, and the live-action 20th Century Fox X-Men film series, in which
      he is portrayed by Hugh Jackman in nine of the ten films. The character is highly
      rated in many comics best-of lists, ranked #1 in Wizard magazine''s 2008 Top
      200 Comic Book Characters;[6] 4th in Empire''s 2008 Greatest Comic Characters;[7]
      and 4th on IGN''s 2011 Top 100 Comic Book Heroes.[8]'

    description: 'Iron Man (Tony Stark) is a fictional superhero appearing in American
      comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by writer
      and editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists
      Don Heck and Jack Kirby. The character made his first appearance in Tales of
      Suspense #39 (cover dated March 1963).


      A wealthy American business magnate, playboy, and ingenious scientist, Tony
      Stark suffers a severe chest injury during a kidnapping in which his captors
      attempt to force him to build a weapon of mass destruction. He instead creates
      a powered suit of armor to save his life and escape captivity. Later, Stark
      augments his suit with weapons and other technological devices he designed through
      his company, Stark Industries. He uses the suit and successive versions to protect
      the world as Iron Man, while at first concealing his true identity. Initially,
      Iron Man was a vehicle for Stan Lee to explore Cold War themes, particularly
      the role of American technology and business in the fight against communism.[1]
      Subsequent re-imaginings of Iron Man have transitioned from Cold War themes
      to contemporary concerns, such as corporate crime and terrorism.[1]


      Throughout most of the character''s publication history, Iron Man has been a
      founding member of the superhero team the Avengers and has been featured in
      several incarnations of his own various comic book series. Iron Man has been
      adapted for several animated TV shows and films. The character is portrayed
      by Robert Downey Jr. in the live action film Iron Man (2008), which was a critical
      and box office success. Downey, who received much acclaim for his performance,
      reprised the role in a cameo in The Incredible Hulk (2008), two Iron Man sequels
      Iron Man 2 (2010) and Iron Man 3 (2013), The Avengers (2012), Avengers: Age
      of Ultron (2015), Captain America: Civil War (2016), and Spider-Man: Homecoming
      (2017), and will do so again in Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and its untitled
      sequel (2019) in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.


      Iron Man was ranked 12th on IGN''s "Top 100 Comic Book Heroes" in 2011,[2] and
      third in their list of "The Top 50 Avengers" in 2012.[3]'

    description: 'Rogue is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books
      published by Marvel Comics, commonly in association with the X-Men. The character
      debuted in Avengers Annual #10 (November 1981) as a villain, but then soon after
      she joined the X-Men.


      Rogue is part of a subspecies of humans called mutants, who are born with superhuman
      abilities. Rogue has the involuntary ability to absorb and sometimes also remove
      the memories, physical strength, and superpowers of anyone she touches. Therefore,
      Rogue considers her powers to be a curse. For most of her life, she limited
      her physical contact with others, including her on-off love interest, Gambit.
      However, after many years, Rogue finally gained full control over her mutant
      ability.


      Hailing from the fictional Caldecott County, Mississippi, Rogue is the X-Men''s
      self-described southern belle. A runaway, she was adopted by Mystique of the
      Brotherhood of Evil Mutants and grew up as a villain. After Rogue permanently
      absorbs Ms. Marvel''s psyche and Kree powers, she reforms and turns to the X-Men,
      fearing for her sanity. Rogue''s real name and early history were not revealed
      until nearly 20 years after her introduction. Until the back story provided
      by Robert Rodi in the ongoing Rogue series, which began in September 2004, Rogue''s
      background was only hinted at. Her name was revealed as Anna Marie, although
      her surname is still unknown. She has sometimes adopted the name Raven, which
      is the first name of her foster mother Mystique.[2]


      Rogue has been one of the most prominent members of the X-Men since the 1980s.
      She was #5 on IGN''s Top 25 X-Men list for 2006,[3] #4 on their Top Ten X-Babes
      list for 2006,[4] #3 on Marvel''s list of Top 10 Toughest Females for 2009[5]
      and was given title of #1 X-Man on CBR''s Top 50 X-Men of All Time for 2008.[6]
      She was ranked tenth in Comics Buyer''s Guide''s "100 Sexiest Women in Comics"
      list.[7] Rogue has been featured in most of the X-Men animated series, and various
      video games. In the X-Men film series, she is portrayed by Anna Paquin. Her
      visual cue is often the white streak that runs through her hair.'

    description: 'Beast (Henry Philip "Hank" McCoy) is a fictional superhero appearing
      in American comic books published by Marvel Comics and is a founding member
      of the X-Men. Originally called "The Beast", the character was introduced as
      a mutant possessing ape-like superhuman physical strength and agility, oversize
      hands and feet, a genius-level intellect, and an otherwise normal appearance.
      Eventually being referred to simply as "Beast", Hank McCoy underwent progressive
      physiological transformations, permanently gaining animalistic physical characteristics.
      These include blue fur, both simian and feline facial features, pointed ears,
      fangs, and claws. Beast''s physical strength and senses increased to even greater
      levels.


      Despite Hank McCoy''s inhuman appearance, he is depicted as a brilliant, well-educated
      man in the arts and sciences, known for his witty sense of humor. He is a world
      authority on biochemistry and genetics, the X-Men''s medical doctor, and the
      science and mathematics instructor at the Xavier Institute (the X-Men''s headquarters
      and school for young mutants). He is also a mutant political activist, campaigning
      against society''s bigotry and discrimination against mutants. While fighting
      his own bestial instincts and fears of social rejection, Beast dedicates his
      physical and mental gifts to the creation of a better world for man and mutant.


      One of the original X-Men, Beast has appeared regularly in X-Men-related comics
      since his debut. He has also been a member of the Avengers and Defenders.


      The character has also appeared in media adaptations, including animated TV
      series and feature films. In X2, Steve Bacic portrayed him in a very brief cameo
      in his human appearance, while in X-Men: The Last Stand he was played by Kelsey
      Grammer. Nicholas Hoult portrays a younger version of the character in X-Men:
      First Class. Both Hoult and Grammer reprise their roles in X-Men: Days of Future
      Past. Hoult also reprised the role in X-Men: Apocalypse.'

    description: 'Magneto is a fictional character appearing in American comic books
      published by Marvel Comics, commonly in association with the X-Men. Created
      by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, the character first appears in The
      X-Men #1 (cover-dated Sept. 1963) as the archenemy of the X-Men.


      The character is a powerful mutant, one of a fictional subspecies of humanity
      born with superhuman abilities, who has the ability to generate and control
      magnetic fields. Magneto regards mutants as evolutionarily superior to humans
      and rejects the possibility of peaceful human-mutant coexistence; he aims to
      conquer the world to enable mutants (whom he refers to as "homo superior") to
      replace humans as the dominant species. Writers have since fleshed out his origins
      and motivations, revealing him to be a Holocaust survivor whose extreme methods
      and cynical philosophy derive from his determination to protect mutantkind from
      suffering a similar fate at the hands of a world that fears and persecutes mutants.
      He is a friend of Professor X, the leader of the X-Men, but their different
      philosophies cause a rift in their friendship at times. Magneto''s role in comics
      has varied from supervillain to antihero to superhero, having served as an occasional
      ally and even a member of the X-Men at times.


      His character''s early history has been compared with the civil rights leader
      Malcolm X[8][9] and Jewish Defense League founder Meir Kahane.[10][11] Magneto
      opposes the pacifist attitude of Professor X and pushes for a more aggressive
      approach to achieving civil rights. In 2011, IGN ranked Magneto as the greatest
      comic book villain of all time.[12]


      Sir Ian McKellen portrayed Magneto in four films of the X-Men film series, while
      Michael Fassbender portrayed a younger version of the character in three films.'

    description: In the primary Earth-616 continuity of the Marvel Universe, Blink
      was introduced in the "Phalanx Covenant" storyline, in which the extraterrestrially
      derived techno-organic beings called the Phalanx captured her and several other
      young mutants to assimilate their powers.[2] This version of Blink was tense
      and panicky and frightened of her powers (having "woken up in a pool of blood"
      after her first use of them). Clarice could not properly control her powers,
      and apparently was unable to teleport anything in an intact form. Instead, any
      object or person caught in Blink's teleportation field, also known as a "blink
      wave", would be shredded. She eventually used her abilities to "cut up" Harvest,
      a Phalanx entity guarding her and her peers, but she was caught in her own teleportation
      field and apparently died in the process.[3] Because of her sacrifice, the remaining
      captives were set free and became the X-Men junior team Generation X.[4]

    description: 'Lampreys (sometimes also called, inaccurately, lamprey eels) are
      any jawless fish of the order Petromyzontiformes, placed in the superclass Cyclostomata.
      The adult lamprey may be characterized by a toothed, funnel-like sucking mouth.
      The common name "lamprey" is probably derived from Latin lampetra, which may
      mean "stone licker" (lambere "to lick" + petra "stone"), though the etymology
      is uncertain.[3]


      Currently there are about 38 known extant species of lampreys.[4] Parasitic
      species are the best known, and feed by boring into the flesh of other fish
      to suck their blood;[5] but only 18 species of lampreys are parasitic.[6] Parasitic
      lampreys also attach themselves to larger animals to get a free ride.[7] Adults
      of the non-parasitic species do not feed; they live off reserves acquired as
      ammocoetes (larvae), which they obtain through filter feeding.


      The lampreys are a very ancient lineage of vertebrates, though their exact relationship
      to hagfishes and jawed vertebrates is still a matter of dispute.'

      While most often played as a team sport with five players on each side, three-on-three,
      two-on-two, and one-on-one competitions are also common. The objective is to
      shoot a ball through a hoop 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter and 10 feet (3.048
      m) high that is mounted to a backboard at each end of the court. The game was

      of the Kansas Jayhawks, one of the most successful programs in the game's history.

    description: 'Deadpool (Wade Winston Wilson) is a fictional antihero appearing
      in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by artist/writer
      Rob Liefeld and writer Fabian Nicieza, the character first appeared in The New
      Mutants #98 (cover-dated February 1991). Initially Deadpool was depicted as
      a supervillain when he made his first appearance in The New Mutants and later
      in issues of X-Force, but later evolved into his more recognizable antiheroic
      persona. Deadpool, whose real name is Wade Wilson, is a disfigured and mentally
      unstable mercenary with the superhuman ability of an accelerated healing factor
      and physical prowess. The character is known as the "Merc with a Mouth" because
      of his talkative nature and tendency to break the fourth wall, which is used
      by writers for humorous effect and running gags.


      The character''s popularity has seen him feature in numerous other media. In
      the 2004 series Cable & Deadpool, he refers to his own scarred appearance as
      "Ryan Reynolds crossed with a Shar Pei".[6][7] Reynolds himself would eventually
      portray the character in the 2009 film X-Men Origins: Wolverine and reprised
      the role in the 2016 film Deadpool.[8][9][10]'

    description: The great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), also known as the
      great white, white pointer, white shark, or white death, is a species of large
      mackerel shark which can be found in the coastal surface waters of all the major
      oceans. The great white shark is notable for its size, with larger female individuals
      growing to 6.1 m (20 ft) in length and 1,950 kg (4,300 lb) in weight at maturity.[3][4][5]
      However most are smaller, males measuring 3.4 to 4.0 m (11 to 13 ft) and females
      4.6 to 4.9 m (15 to 16 ft) on average.[5][6] According to a 2014 study the lifespan
      of great white sharks is estimated to be as long as 70 years or more, well above
      previous estimates,[7] making it one of the longest lived cartilaginous fish
      currently known.[8] According to the same study, male great white sharks take
      26 years to reach sexual maturity, while the females take 33 years to be ready
      to produce offspring.[9] Great white sharks can swim at speeds of over 56 km/h
      (35 mph),[10] and can swim to depths of 1,200 m (3,900 ft).[11]

    description: Watermelon Citrullus lanatus var. lanatus is a scrambling and trailing
      vine in the flowering plant family Cucurbitaceae. The species originated in
      southern Africa, and there is evidence of its cultivation in Ancient Egypt.
      It is grown in tropical and sub-tropical areas worldwide for its large edible
      fruit, also known as a watermelon, which is a special kind of berry with a hard
      rind and no internal division, botanically called a pepo. The sweet, juicy flesh
      is usually deep red to pink, with many black seeds. The fruit can be eaten raw
      or pickled and the rind is edible after cooking.

    description: 'The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly
      perfect sphere of hot plasma,[13][14] with internal convective motion that generates
      a magnetic field via a dynamo process.[15] It is by far the most important source
      of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth,
      and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86%
      of the total mass of the Solar System.[16] About three quarters of the Sun''s
      mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much
      smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and
      iron.[17]


      The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V) based on its spectral class. As
      such, it is informally referred to as a yellow dwarf. It formed approximately
      4.6 billion[a][9][18] years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within
      a region of a large molecular cloud. Most of this matter gathered in the center,
      whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System.
      The central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear
      fusion in its core. It is thought that almost all stars form by this process.


      The Sun is roughly middle-aged; it has not changed dramatically for more than
      four billion[a] years, and will remain fairly stable for more than another five
      billion years. After hydrogen fusion in its core has diminished to the point
      at which it is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium, the core of the Sun will
      experience a marked increase in density and temperature while its outer layers
      expand to eventually become a red giant. It is calculated that the Sun will
      become sufficiently large to engulf the current orbits of Mercury and Venus,
      and render Earth uninhabitable.


      The enormous effect of the Sun on Earth has been recognized since prehistoric
      times, and the Sun has been regarded by some cultures as a deity. The synodic
      rotation of Earth and its orbit around the Sun are the basis of the solar calendar,
      which is the predominant calendar in use today.'

    description: 'Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the
      Universe known to harbor life. According to radiometric dating and other sources
      of evidence, Earth formed over 4 billion years ago.[24][25][26] Earth''s gravity
      interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon, Earth''s
      only natural satellite. During one orbit around the Sun, Earth rotates about
      its axis about 365.26 times; thus, an Earth year is about 365.26 days long.[n
      5]


      Earth''s axis of rotation is tilted, producing seasonal variations on the planet''s
      surface.[27] The gravitational interaction between the Earth and Moon causes
      ocean tides, stabilizes the Earth''s orientation on its axis, and gradually
      slows its rotation.[28] Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System and
      the largest of the four terrestrial planets.


      Earth''s lithosphere is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate
      across the surface over periods of many millions of years. About 71% of Earth''s
      surface is covered with water, mostly by its oceans.[29] The remaining 29% is
      land consisting of continents and islands that together have many lakes, rivers
      and other sources of water that contribute to the hydrosphere. The majority
      of Earth''s polar regions are covered in ice, including the Antarctic ice sheet
      and the sea ice of the Arctic ice pack. Earth''s interior remains active with
      a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates the Earth''s magnetic
      field, and a convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics.


      Within the first billion years of Earth''s history, life appeared in the oceans
      and began to affect the Earth''s atmosphere and surface, leading to the proliferation
      of aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Some geological evidence indicates that
      life may have arisen as much as 4.1 billion years ago. Since then, the combination
      of Earth''s distance from the Sun, physical properties, and geological history
      have allowed life to evolve and thrive.[30][31] In the history of the Earth,
      biodiversity has gone through long periods of expansion, occasionally punctuated
      by mass extinction events. Over 99% of all species[32] that ever lived on Earth
      are extinct.[33][34] Estimates of the number of species on Earth today vary
      widely;[35][36][37] most species have not been described.[38] Over 7.4 billion
      humans live on Earth and depend on its biosphere and minerals for their survival.
      Humans have developed diverse societies and cultures; politically, the world
      has about 200 sovereign states.'

      \ are planned, including the Mars 2020 and ExoMars rovers.[20][21][22][23] Liquid\
      \ water cannot exist on the surface of Mars due to low atmospheric pressure,\
      \ which is less than 1% of the Earth's,[24] except at the lowest elevations\
      \ for short periods.[25][26] The two polar ice caps appear to be made largely\
      \ of water.[27][28] The volume of water ice in the south polar ice cap, if melted,\
      \ would be sufficient to cover the entire planetary surface to a depth of 11\
      \ meters (36 ft).[29] In November 2016, NASA reported finding a large amount\
      \ of underground ice in the Utopia Planitia region of Mars. The volume of water\
      \ detected has been estimated to be equivalent to the volume of water in Lake\
      \ Superior.[30][31][32]\n\nMars can easily be seen from Earth with the naked\
      \ eye, as can its reddish coloring. Its apparent magnitude reaches \u22122.91,[7]\
      \ which is surpassed only by Jupiter, Venus, the Moon, and the Sun. Optical\
      \ ground-based telescopes are typically limited to resolving features about\
      \ 300 kilometers (190 mi) across when Earth and Mars are closest because of\
      \ Earth's atmosphere.[33]"

    description: "Venus is the second planet from the Sun, orbiting it every 224.7\
      \ Earth days.[12] It has the longest rotation period (243 days) of any planet\
      \ in the Solar System and rotates in the opposite direction to most other planets.\
      \ It has no natural satellites. It is named after the Roman goddess of love\
      \ and beauty. It is the second-brightest natural object in the night sky after\
      \ the Moon, reaching an apparent magnitude of \u22124.6 \u2013 bright enough\
      \ to cast shadows at night and, rarely, visible to the naked eye in broad daylight.[13][14]\
      \ Orbiting within Earth's orbit, Venus is an inferior planet and never appears\
      \ to venture far from the Sun; its maximum angular distance from the Sun (elongation)\
      \ is 47.8\xB0.\n\nVenus is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called Earth's\
      \ \"sister planet\" because of their similar size, mass, proximity to the Sun,\
      \ and bulk composition. It is radically different from Earth in other respects.\
      \ It has the densest atmosphere of the four terrestrial planets, consisting\
      \ of more than 96% carbon dioxide. The atmospheric pressure at the planet's\
      \ surface is 92 times that of Earth, or roughly the pressure found 900 m (3,000\
      \ ft) underwater on Earth. Venus is by far the hottest planet in the Solar System,\
      \ with a mean surface temperature of 735 K (462 \xB0C; 863 \xB0F), even though\
      \ Mercury is closer to the Sun. Venus is shrouded by an opaque layer of highly\
      \ reflective clouds of sulfuric acid, preventing its surface from being seen\
      \ from space in visible light. It may have had water oceans in the past,[15][16]\
      \ but these would have vaporized as the temperature rose due to a runaway greenhouse\
      \ effect.[17] The water has probably photodissociated, and the free hydrogen\
      \ has been swept into interplanetary space by the solar wind because of the\
      \ lack of a planetary magnetic field.[18] Venus's surface is a dry desertscape\
      \ interspersed with slab-like rocks and is periodically resurfaced by volcanism.\n\
      \nAs one of the brightest objects in the sky, Venus has been a major fixture\
      \ in human culture for as long as records have existed. It has been made sacred\
      \ to gods of many cultures, and has been a prime inspiration for writers and\
      \ poets as the \"morning star\" and \"evening star\". Venus was the first planet\
      \ to have its motions plotted across the sky, as early as the second millennium\
      \ BC.[19]\n\nAs the closest planet to Earth, Venus has been a prime target for\
      \ early interplanetary exploration. It was the first planet beyond Earth visited\
      \ by a spacecraft (Mariner 2 in 1962), and the first to be successfully landed\
      \ on (by Venera 7 in 1970). Venus's thick clouds render observation of its surface\
      \ impossible in visible light, and the first detailed maps did not emerge until\
      \ the arrival of the Magellan orbiter in 1991. Plans have been proposed for\
      \ rovers or more complex missions, but they are hindered by Venus's hostile\
      \ surface conditions."

      \ about nine times that of Earth.[11][12] Although it has only one-eighth the\
      \ average density of Earth, with its larger volume Saturn is just over 95 times\
      \ more massive.[13][14][15] Saturn is named after the Roman god of agriculture;\
      \ its astronomical symbol (\u2644) represents the god's sickle.\n\nSaturn's\
      \ interior is probably composed of a core of iron\u2013nickel and rock (silicon\

      \ hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and\
      \ finally outside the Frenkel line a gaseous outer layer.[16] Saturn has a pale\
      \ yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. Electrical current\
      \ within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary\
      \ magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth's, but has a magnetic moment 580\
      \ times that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size. Saturn's magnetic field strength\
      \ is around one-twentieth of Jupiter's.[17] The outer atmosphere is generally\

      \ that is composed mostly of ice particles with a smaller amount of rocky debris\
      \ and dust. 62 moons[19] are known to orbit Saturn, of which fifty-three are\

      \ Sun, but two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System\
      \ combined. Jupiter and Saturn are gas giants; the other two giant planets,\
      \ Uranus and Neptune are ice giants. Jupiter has been known to astronomers since\
      \ antiquity.[12] The Romans named it after their god Jupiter.[13] When viewed\
      \ from Earth, Jupiter can reach an apparent magnitude of \u22122.94, bright\
      \ enough for its reflected light to cast shadows,[14] and making it on average\
      \ the third-brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.\n\n\
      Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen with a quarter of its mass being helium,\
      \ though helium comprises only about a tenth of the number of molecules. It\
      \ may also have a rocky core of heavier elements,[15] but like the other giant\
      \ planets, Jupiter lacks a well-defined solid surface. Because of its rapid\
      \ rotation, the planet's shape is that of an oblate spheroid (it has a slight\
      \ but noticeable bulge around the equator). The outer atmosphere is visibly\
      \ segregated into several bands at different latitudes, resulting in turbulence\
      \ and storms along their interacting boundaries. A prominent result is the Great\
      \ Red Spot, a giant storm that is known to have existed since at least the 17th\
      \ century when it was first seen by telescope. Surrounding Jupiter is a faint\
      \ planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere. Jupiter has at least 69\
      \ moons,[16] including the four large Galilean moons discovered by Galileo Galilei\
      \ in 1610. Ganymede, the largest of these, has a diameter greater than that\
      \ of the planet Mercury.\n\nJupiter has been explored on several occasions by\
      \ robotic spacecraft, most notably during the early Pioneer and Voyager flyby\
      \ missions and later by the Galileo orbiter. In late February 2007, Jupiter\
      \ was visited by the New Horizons probe, which used Jupiter's gravity to increase\
      \ its speed and bend its trajectory en route to Pluto. The latest probe to visit\
      \ the planet is Juno, which entered into orbit around Jupiter on July 4, 2016.[17][18]\
      \ Future targets for exploration in the Jupiter system include the probable\
      \ ice-covered liquid ocean of its moon Europa."

    description: "Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in\
      \ the Solar System. In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by\
      \ diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. Neptune\
      \ is 17 times the mass of Earth and is slightly more massive than its near-twin\
      \ Uranus, which is 15 times the mass of Earth and slightly larger than Neptune.[d]\
      \ Neptune orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1\
      \ astronomical units (4.50\xD7109 km). It is named after the Roman god of the\
      \ sea and has the astronomical symbol \u2646, a stylised version of the god\
      \ Neptune's trident.\n\nNeptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the\
      \ only planet in the Solar System found by mathematical prediction rather than\
      \ by empirical observation. Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis\
      \ Bouvard to deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation\
      \ by an unknown planet. Neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on\
      \ 23 September 1846[1] by Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted\
      \ by Urbain Le Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter,\
      \ though none of the planet's remaining known 14 moons were located telescopically\
      \ until the 20th century. The planet's distance from Earth gives it a very small\
      \ apparent size, making it challenging to study with Earth-based telescopes.\
      \ Neptune was visited by Voyager 2, when it flew by the planet on 25 August\
      \ 1989.[11] The advent of the Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based\
      \ telescopes with adaptive optics has recently allowed for additional detailed\
      \ observations from afar.\n\nLike Jupiter and Saturn, Neptune's atmosphere is\
      \ composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, along with traces of hydrocarbons\
      \ and possibly nitrogen, but it contains a higher proportion of \"ices\" such\
      \ as water, ammonia, and methane. However, its interior, like that of Uranus,\
      \ is primarily composed of ices and rock,[12] which is why Uranus and Neptune\
      \ are normally considered \"ice giants\" to emphasise this distinction.[13]\
      \ Traces of methane in the outermost regions in part account for the planet's\
      \ blue appearance.[14]\n\nIn contrast to the hazy, relatively featureless atmosphere\
      \ of Uranus, Neptune's atmosphere has active and visible weather patterns. For\
      \ example, at the time of the Voyager 2 flyby in 1989, the planet's southern\
      \ hemisphere had a Great Dark Spot comparable to the Great Red Spot on Jupiter.\
      \ These weather patterns are driven by the strongest sustained winds of any\
      \ planet in the Solar System, with recorded wind speeds as high as 2,100 kilometres\
      \ per hour (580 m/s; 1,300 mph).[15] Because of its great distance from the\
      \ Sun, Neptune's outer atmosphere is one of the coldest places in the Solar\
      \ System, with temperatures at its cloud tops approaching 55 K (\u2212218 \xB0\
      C). Temperatures at the planet's centre are approximately 5,400 K (5,100 \xB0\
      C).[16][17] Neptune has a faint and fragmented ring system (labelled \"arcs\"\
      ), which was discovered in 1982, then later confirmed by Voyager 2.[18]"

    description: 'Azeroth is the name of the world in which the majority of the Warcraft
      series is set. The world of Azeroth is the birthplace of many races, most notable
      being elves (night elves, high elves, and blood elves), humans, dwarves, tauren,
      goblins, trolls, gnomes, pandarens and dragons. At its birth, Azeroth was blessed
      by the titans. One day, the demonic armies of the Burning Legion came and shattered
      the peace and led the night elves to sunder their world. Gradually, races were
      dragged to Azeroth (such as the orcs, draenei, and ogres), others evolved, and
      others were brought up from the dust itself.


      The peoples of Azeroth have fought brutally against the demons and their servants,
      and much blood was, and is still being, shed. After the Third War, three major
      powers emerged: the Scourge, Horde, and Alliance. Other major powers include
      the naga, qiraji, and Scarlet Crusade. Although ravaged by conflict, somehow
      through trickery, betrayal, and sheer blood, Azeroth has survived the Burning
      Legion four times. However, Azeroth is still torn by conflict, hate, and war.'

    description: 'The killer whale or orca (Orcinus orca) is a toothed whale belonging
      to the oceanic dolphin family, of which it is the largest member. Killer whales
      have a diverse diet, although individual populations often specialize in particular
      types of prey. Some feed exclusively on fish, while others hunt marine mammals
      such as seals and dolphins. They have been known to attack baleen whale calves,

      that preys on them. Killer whales are considered a cosmopolitan species, and
      can be found in each of the world''s oceans in a variety of marine environments,
      from Arctic and Antarctic regions to tropical seas.


      Killer whales are highly social; some populations are composed of matrilineal
      family groups (pods) which are the most stable of any animal species.[5] Their
      sophisticated hunting techniques and vocal behaviours, which are often specific

    requirements: Killer whales are found in all oceans and most seas. Due to their
      enormous range, numbers, and density, distributional estimates are difficult
      to compare, but they clearly prefer higher latitudes and coastal areas over
      pelagic environments.

    description: "The gray wolf or grey wolf (Canis lupus),[a] also known as the timber\
      \ wolf[3][4] or western wolf,[b] is a canine native to the wilderness and remote\
      \ areas of Eurasia and North America. It is the largest extant member of its\
      \ family, with males averaging 43\u201345 kg (95\u201399 lb) and females 36\u2013\
      38.5 kg (79\u201385 lb).[6] Like the red wolf, it is distinguished from other\
      \ Canis species by its larger size and less pointed features, particularly on\
      \ the ears and muzzle.[7] Its winter fur is long and bushy and predominantly\
      \ a mottled gray in color, although nearly pure white, red, and brown to black\
      \ also occur.[4] As of 2005,[8] 37 subspecies of C. lupus are recognised by\
      \ MSW3.\n\nThe gray wolf is the second most specialised member of the genus\
      \ Canis, after the Ethiopian wolf, as demonstrated by its morphological adaptations\
      \ to hunting large prey, its more gregarious nature,[9] and its highly advanced\
      \ expressive behavior.[10][11] It is nonetheless closely related enough to smaller\
      \ Canis species, such as the eastern wolf,[5] coyote,[12] and golden jackal,[13][14]\
      \ to produce fertile hybrids. It is the only species of Canis to have a range\
      \ encompassing both the Old and New Worlds,[5] and originated in Eurasia during\
      \ the Pleistocene, colonizing North America on at least three separate occasions\
      \ during the Rancholabrean.[5] It is a social animal, travelling in nuclear\
      \ families consisting of a mated pair, accompanied by the pair's adult offspring.[15]\
      \ The gray wolf is typically an apex predator throughout its range, with only\
      \ humans and tigers[9][16][17][18] posing a serious threat to it. It feeds primarily\
      \ on large ungulates, though it also eats smaller animals, livestock, carrion,\
      \ and garbage.[4]"

      \ denotes the several subspecies in Africa. With some males exceeding 250 kg\
      \ (550 lb) in weight,[5] it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger,\
      \ barring hybrids like the liger.[6][7] Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan\
      \ Africa and in India (where an endangered remnant population resides in and\
      \ around Gir Forest National Park). In ancient historic times, their range was\
      \ in most of Africa, including North Africa, and across Eurasia from Greece\
      \ and southeastern Europe to India. In the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years\
      \ ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans: Panthera\
      \ leo spelaea lived in northern and western Europe and Panthera leo atrox lived\
      \ in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru.[8] The lion is classified as a vulnerable\
      \ species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), having\
      \ seen a major population decline in its African range of 30\u201350% over two\
      \ decades during the second half of the twentieth century.[3] Lion populations\
      \ are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the\
      \ cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with\
      \ humans are the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa, the West African\
      \ lion population is particularly endangered."
